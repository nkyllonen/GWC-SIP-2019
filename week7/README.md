- How to view your local website on your phone:
	1. open either Git Bash or Command Prompt
	2. navigate to the directory that contains your html, etc. files
	3. run the Python directory
		- run the command: `python -m http.server`
	4. get the IP Address of your computer
		- open Control Panel>Network and Internet>Network and Sharing Center
		- click on the wifi name (look at `wifi-connection.png` for a picture)
		- in the newly opened window, click "Details"
		- find the IPv4 Address value
	5. open the page on your phone
		- open a browser: Chrome, Safari, etc.
		- open a new tab and type: `<your IPv4 Address>:8000`
		- NOTE: 8000 is the default port number on which your python server is running, if you wanted to run it on a different port number, you would run: `python -m http.server <other port number>`
