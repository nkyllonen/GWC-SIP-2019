    Self-Introduction
    Hi, my name is Nikki and I live in the San Francisco Bay Area. I grew up with Aussies all of my life and consider myself thoroughly obsessed with the dog breed. For the past several years, we’ve had two Aussies at a time, so that they can keep each other company and play together.
    My Aussies
    Our current two Aussies are a Blue Merle and a Black Tri: Mika and Marco, respectively.

    Location
    Aussies, although their name seems to suggest the continent of Australia, are actually an American breed. Because of this fact, some have tried to change their name to “American Shepherds,” but that movement has yet to win the hearts of all Aussie lovers.

    Coats
    Aussies come in 4 primary coats, or fur patterns:
    Blue Merle
    Red Merle
    Black Tri
    Red Tri
    The Merle patterns are characterized by bodies mostly covered with a lighter, non-white color that is speckles and splotches of darker shades. For Blue Merles, the lighter color is a shade of grey that is then filled with black spots. For Red Merles, the lighter color is a shade of tan that is then filled with brown spots.
    The Tri color patterns are characterized by bodies mostly covered with the primary color (either black or reddish brown) that is then accented with two other colors: white and caramel. This combination of three is what gives the pattern its name.
