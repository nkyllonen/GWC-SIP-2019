<h2>My First Web Page</h2>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

<p>Never call document.write() after the document has finished loading.
It will overwrite the whole document.</p>

<!-- since this write() is WITHIN the HTML, it will not overwrite -->
<script>
document.write(5 + 6);
</script>

<!-- since this write() only happens on a button click, it WILL overwrite -->
<!-- a button click happens after the HTML has loaded -->
<button type="button" onclick="document.write(5 + 6)">Try it</button>

<!-- best practice for trying to shorten lines - split after an operator -->
<script>
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
"Hello Dolly!";
</script>
