	- clubs/sports

- Resume nice-to-haves
	- hobbies
	- photo (watch formatting - pocket-sized!)
	- objective/summary
	- length (coming out of HS or college, 1 page should be good)
	- keep it clean! watch your fancy formatting - keep out infographics and such
- Resume don't haves
	- full address (for the sake of your security or safety)
	- social media (unless it's relevent! Like Github)
	- slang (be careful about your objective or your descriptions)
	- unusual or fancy formatting
	- references (fully optional, 3 is safe)
- Formatting notes:
	- some recruiters find color unprofessional and should only be used for more artsy positions
	- easy to scan, easy to read
	- sections and headers and bullet points
	- putting things in chronological order (more relevant and more recent on top)
	- PROOFREAD!
- NOTES:
	- recruiter's preference
	- don't submit something generic
	- really show why you're interested and how your background supports you
	- be careful, because a bulky cover letter can hold a lot of mistakes (proofread!)
	- often used by recruiters that are unsure
	- save as a pdf! same for resumes!
	- really think about your audience!
	- have multiple copies! make different ones tailored towards different audiences
	- they don't want to read a novel - keep it clean and concise
	- GPA: provide it if you're asked, it's not super important - if it's really nice, then probably want to show it off, but don't have tio
	- stay consistent with tense! it depends on your preference, but make sure your descriptions are at the very least

# LinkedIn Workshop

# Panel Notes
	- it's okay to go into college not knowing
	- you CAN change majors! it's a thing that many people do
	- look into auditing classes! or taking them pass/fail! For some people, this can give you freedom to try different things with less stress about grades
	- look into schools that may allow you to "design your own major" if you're concerned about having interdisciplinary interests that don't overlap much - you might be able to find a way!
	- "internships are like dating before marriage" - learn what it's like earlier!
	- keep learning, keep challenging yourself - maybe have a goal and choose a tougher path
	- how to explore?
		- talk to other people about what they do!
		- ask people with jobs
		- what do they do?
		- go to company websites -- contact me, about us -- reach out and ask! Express your interest through email, learn about the company
		- networking! LinkedIn! ask friends, connect with people
		- read about companies, follow them on social media
		- be persistent! (possible goals: talk to one new person a week, explore one new thing each month)

		- put yourself in uncomfortable situations -- know how to speak and communicate
		- don't be afraid of unpaid internships
		- learn to thrive in uncomfortable situations -- thrive in ambiguity and uncertainty
	- college choices:
		- size
		- general education
		- go by your gut feelings -- visit, sit back, and take it all in
		- languages available
		- basketball game..?
		- a good college doesn't guarantee success, it guarantees an initial "wow"
		- money
		- start at a community college -- can try to figure things out here before transfering
		- top schools are tough!
		- the student life / community -- what is it like to be a student there? ask students!

		- reach out to people and ask them for their perspectives
		- informal / informational interviews with prospective students
		- class sizes -- learning style (small group, big group?)
		- school ranking isn't everything!

		- ask! keep asking
		- google it!

		- sometimes you don't know what is a good fit for you! maybe you think you know, but sometimes someone else will tell you "I think you'd be a good fit for _______"
	- undergraduate research
		- talk to professors! ask them about their research (do some background reading about their publications first! sounds a lot better if you have an idea first)
	- how to stand out
		- articulate why you're the right person for the role and why the company is right for you
		- 15 min a day, try to write something -- it takes a long time and a lot of work to find the words to express why you're a good choice
		- building a personality and "brand" -- volunteering, coding competition, online coding challenges, etc
		- how do you come across? what's your attitude?
		- what do you bring to the table?
